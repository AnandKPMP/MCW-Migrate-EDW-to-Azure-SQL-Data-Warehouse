# Migrating and Enterprise Data Warehouse to Azure SQL Database

This session will look at the process of migrating an on-premises data warehouse to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. Throughout the whiteboard design session and hands-on lab, we will look at the planning process for data warehouse migration, identifying schema and data incompatibilities, efficiently migrating data from on-premises databases to the cloud, data distribution in Azure SQL Data Warehouse, migrating ETL jobs to Azure Data Factory, and supporting ad-hoc workloads in an Azure SQL Data Warehouse through Azure Analysis Services.

# Whiteboard Design Session

This whiteboard design session will look at the process of migrating an on-premises data warehouse to Azure SQL Data Warehouse. The design session will cover planning for a data warehouse migration, data and schema preparation, data loading, optimizing the data distribution, and building a solution to support ad-hoc queries.

# Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab you will migrate an existing on-premises enterprise data warehouse to the cloud. We will investigate the current data warehouse to identify any incompatibilities, we will export the data from the on-premises data warehouse and transfer it to Azure Blob Storage. We will then load the data into the warehouse. Finally we will integrate the warehouse by migrating ETL to Azure Data Factory and supporting ad-hoc access by implementing Azure Analysis Services.

# Azure Services Used 

- Azure SQL Data Warehouse
