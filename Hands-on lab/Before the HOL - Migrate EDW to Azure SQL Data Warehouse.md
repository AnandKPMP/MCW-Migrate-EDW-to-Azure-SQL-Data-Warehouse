## Migrate EDW to Azure SQL Data Warehouse before the hands-on lab set up guide

In this exercise, you will deploy the source environment for this lab. The source environment is designed to represent the existing on-premises environment you will migrate to Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

### Task 1: Deploy the source environment

1.  Browse to the Azure Portal at <https://portal.azure.com> and provision a Windows Server 2016 with SQL 2016 SP2 developer VM with following settings.

2.  Click **+Create a resource,** and type **SQL Server 2016** in the search box. Choose the latest service pack version of **Free License: SQL Server 2016 SP2 Developer on Windows Server 2016** from the search results. ![](images/Setup/image3.png)

3.  Click the **Create** button to begin deployment of the SQL Server

4.  On the Basics blade, use the following configurations:

    -   Name: **SQLcohoDW**

    -   VM disk type: **Premium SSD**

    -   User name: **demouser**

    -   Password: **Demo\@pass123**

    -   Subscription: ***Your subscription***

    -   Resource Group: **Create new** - **CohoOnPremEnvironment**

    -   Location: ***Choose a location near you***

5.  On the size blade, choose **D2s\_v3**. If this option is not available in your chosen region, choose DS2\_V2.

 
6.  On the Settings blade, select **RDP (3389)** in the **Select public inbound ports** dropdown and change the Auto-shutdown time zone to reflect your current time zone. Then, click **OK**.

 
7.  On the SQL Server settings blade, enable SQL Authentication, and click **OK**


8.  On the Summary blade, review your settings. Then, click **Create**.

### Task 2: Configure the SQL Server

1.  Login to the **SQLcochoDW** virtual machine you created in the previous task


2.  From Server Manager, click on **Local Server** select **IE Enhanced Security Configuration,** and set it to **Off**

    ![In the Server Manager menu, Local Server is selected.](images/Setup/image8.png)

    ![In the Everything section, IE Ehanced Security Configuration, which is set to Off, is selected.](images/Setup/image9.png)

3.  Install the Azure PowerShell command-line tools from:

    <https://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx/getinstaller/WindowsAzurePowershellGet.3f.3f.3fnew.appids>

4.  Open **Windows PowerShell ISE**, copy and paste the following code into the script window and execute it by clicking the green button. The picture below shows the code properly pasted into the script window. Verify that your code does not have any extraneous line wrapping. 

    ```
    $Path = $env:TEMP; 
    $Installer = "chrome_installer.exe"
    Invoke-WebRequest "http://dl.google.com/chrome/install/375.126/chrome_installer.exe" -OutFile $Path\$Installer
    Start-Process -FilePath $Path\$Installer -Args "/silent /install" -Verb RunAs -Wait
    Remove-Item $Path\$Installer
    ```

5.  Open **File Explorer,** and create two new folders called **C:\\LabFiles, C:\\Migration**

5.  Download the Student Files from <http://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/migrate-edw/StudentFiles-06-2018.zip>, and extract the files to **C:\\LabFiles**

    ![The Extract Zipped folders window displays. In the Browse field, C:\\LabFiles\\ displays.](images/Setup/image10.png)

6.  Launch **SQL Server Management Studio,** and connect to the SQLcohoDW instance

7.  Open a **New Query** window, and cut/paste the following code into the window

    ```
    RESTORE DATABASE CohoDW FROM DISK = 'C:\LabFiles\CohoDW.bak' 
    WITH MOVE 'CohoDW_Data' TO 'F:\Data\CohoDW_Data.mdf'
       , MOVE 'CohoDW_Log' TO 'F:\Log\CohoDW_Log.ldf'
    ```

9.  Click **Execute** to restore the database

        -   Allow azure services to access server: ***checked***

    -   Pricing tier: **S1**

    

You should follow all steps provided _before_ performing the Hands-on lab.
